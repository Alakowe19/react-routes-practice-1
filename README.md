# React Routes Practice 1

## Setup

1. Fork this repository
2. Clone the forked repository onto your local machines
3. In the root directory, type `npm ci`, which installs dependencies for the project
4. Finally, type `npm run dev`, which starts a development server that runs your website in the browser. That server
   will reload your website whenever you make any changes to source files

## Instructions
- In App.jsx, routes are set up for Home and Products
- Add another route, "/apps", that goes to the `Apps` component
  - NOTE - this is different and unrelated to the `App.jsx` file
  - "Apps" here refers to applications you can download from the Apple Store
- Add a link to this route in the navigation section, using the `<Link>` element
